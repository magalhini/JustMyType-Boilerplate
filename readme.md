## JustMyType Boilerplate 

## Alpha 0.4

#This version is not yet complete for public use.

What it is:

* A collection of CSS/JS aimed to improve typography on a new web project.
* A simple re-usable grid system with pre-defined values for white-space balance.
* Pre-defined media queries that adjust your grid & type to different devices.
* A solid boilerplate for a new web project.

What it has:

* An out-of-the-box CSS template ready to use with default text sizes.
* A CSS/LESS file you can modify which automically calculates custom values for your type.
* Javascript helpers for the grid and baseline system.

How to use:

* Right now, you must include the LESS file, but give me some time to release a more interesting version :)
