			<h1>Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV</h1> <p>What are their names? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p> <h2>The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz</h2> <p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Hello Morbo, how's the family? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p> <ul> <li>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say.</li> <li>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say.</li> <li>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</li> </ul> <h3>The 30% Iron Chef</h3> <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p> <h4>Space Pilot 3000</h4> <p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! A sexy mistake. Kids have names? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p> <ol> <li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li> <li>Guess again.</li> <li>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</li> <li>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</li> </ol> <h5>That's Lobstertainment</h5> <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Moving along&hellip; Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
